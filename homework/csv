SIS CSV Importing

Schools use many different Student Information Systems, some commercial, some homegrown, some are even just an excel spreadsheet.

In this problem we're only going to consider three data types: Students, Courses, and Enrollments. Enrollments is a join between Students and Courses.

student columns:    user_id,   user_name,   state
course columns:     course_id, course_name, state
enrollment columns: user_id,   course_id,   state
For all data types, state is in ['active', 'deleted']. The user_id and course_id are globally unique, so a new id means a new record, an id they've seen before means an update to an existing record.

Attached is a .zip of CSVs (found in the assets folder called CSV.zip). You should write a program that processes the files in order. You'll need to determine the type of data in the csv based on the headers in the first row. At the end, you need to spit out a list of active courses, and for each course a list of active students with active enrollments in that course.

Some gotchas:

Some of the enrollments are invalid (reference non-existing user or course).
Watch out for quoting problems if you try to parse the CSVs by hand
An active enrollment might point to a deleted user, and enrollments may be deleted as well.
Column order in the CSV is unspecified, one user csv may be ordered differently than the next.
