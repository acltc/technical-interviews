A: Table Structure

A database system needs to model the following:
Company: The system manages data for many Companies. Each Company has a name attribute.
Each Company also offers one or more Medical Plans to its employees.
Medical Plan: Each Medical Plan has a name attribute and belongs to exactly one Sponsor. Each Medical Plan is available to one or more Employee Groups.
Employee Group: Each Employee Group has a name attribute and belongs to exactly one Company. Each Employee Group has access to one or more Medical Plans.
1. Write SQL to create the tables for these entities.
2. Write SQL to retrieve all of the Medical Plans for a given Company.
3. Write SQL to retrieve all of the Employee Groups for a given Company.
4. Write SQL to retrieve all of the Employee Groups who may access a given Medical Plan.
5. Write SQL to retrieve all of the Medical Plans that may be accessed by a given Employee Group.

B: Writing Queries
The following tables and data are defined in a schema:

select * from department;

department_id   |  name
10                 Sales
20                 Marketing
30                 Development
40￼                Administration

select * from employee;

employee_id  | name         | department_id
1              Washington     10
2              Adams          10
3              Jefferson      20  
4              Monroe         20
5              Jackson        20
6              Lincoln        30
7              Johnson        30 
8              Madison        30 

￼Write SQL to return the following output:

department_id | name           | employee_id | name         | department_id
10              Sales            1             Washington     10
10              Sales            2             Adams          10
20              Marketing        3             Jefferson      20
20              Marketing        4             Monroe         20
20              Marketing        5             Jackson        20
30              Development      6             Lincoln        30
30              Development      7             Johnson        30
30              Development      8             Madison        30
40              Administration   NULL          NULL           NULL


C: Optimization
A query is performing more slowly than you would like. What is the first thing you would research when determining how to speed it up?
